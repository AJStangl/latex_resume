%\lettersection{About Me}
As a molecular biologist and software engineer my passion is centered around transforming genomic data into information that improves patient outcomes. I came across the job listing for software engineer after search through JHU and after reading through your mission, technology, and services you offer I'm confident that I can add value to the software application development team.

%\lettersection{Why Me?}
In my capacity as a bioinformatics software engineer I have been developing software and workflows for the analysis next-generation sequencing technology in CLIA and FDA regulated environments. In addition to leading efforts for analytical pipelines; I have acted in roles that require a knowledge of workflows in LIMs, database integrations and queries, and the development of software that produce client facing reports.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of software capable of handling NGS data from Plasma and FFPE Tissue at extreme coverages
  \item Implimentation and analysis for protein and DNA microarray technologies
  \item Highly familiar working with LIMs and databases
  \item Excellent technical documentation skills and ability to mentor
  \item Trained in software design, lifecycle, and design control
\end{itemize}
A major strength I would bring to CIDR is my direct experience working as a bioinformatic software engineer where the environment is under design control delivery of well tested production ready code is the expectation. Pairing my current experience with my prior experience as a wet lab scientist working directly with microarray and NGS technology is what sets me apart and why I believe I would be an excellent fit for your position.
%\lettersection{Next Steps}

I welcome the opportunity to speak with you and your team regarding how my experience and background makes me an excellent fit for the position and look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.
