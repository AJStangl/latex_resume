# Introduction
 Forked (In so far and I cloned it, modified, and removed all the stuff I didn't want) 
 version of awesome CV LatEX Resume. 
 
 There is a MakeFile but I maintain this on a windows and Mac OS so it doesn't always play
 nice. 
 
 To Anyone who made it this far in my repo and actually is reading the markdown file. Hi!
